This program is designed to quiz you on the capitals of European countries.

Here’s how it works:

Quiz Setup: It starts by creating a dictionary called quiz that contains ten European countries and their corresponding capitals.

Scoring: You begin with a score of zero to track your correct answers throughout the quiz.

Answer Checking: A function called check_guess verifies your answers. You have three attempts to guess the capital for each country, and if you get it right, your score increases by one.

Taking the Quiz: The program prompts you to guess the capitals of the listed countries. It iterates through each country, asking for your answer.

Your Responses: As you provide your guesses, the program checks each one. If you miss, it allows for two more tries before revealing the correct answer.

Final Score: After you’ve answered all the questions, the program displays your final score, showing how many you got right out of the total.
